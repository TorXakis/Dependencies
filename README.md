Versions of external software TorXakis depends on

This repository is used for providing versions of external software that TorXakis depends on, during creation of TorXakis releases.
Some of such software (eg:cvc4) don't have stable versions yet and the versions we use may becomes unavailable after a while.
Thus their copies are provided here.

Many tools only have x86_64 distribution packages. This repository contains Dockerfiles to build the distribution packages tools for the arm64 platform required for the torxakis tool. The build distribution packages from these Dockerfiles are available in the releases of this repository.
